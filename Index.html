            <h1>My Story</h1>
              <p> A versatile cellist and Juilliard graduate, Talia held a leadership position in a major symphony orchestra before the COVID-19 pandemic. When the virus caused her and countless other professional musicians to lose their jobs, she began studying user experience and design interaction. Now she is helping people adapt to virtual platforms in a world that continues to be socially distanced for the foreseeable future.</p>
              <p>In addition to UX, Talia enjoys learning languages, reading horror stories, skit-writing, and playing with her cats.</p><br>
